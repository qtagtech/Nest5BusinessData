        We have received a row of data, it may be an Insert, update or delete of any table and in any client.
        First, the system looks for the same element (table + rowid) between timeReceived and timeSaved which comes from directly from the client.
        If there is a record between those two times, the response must be an orther to discard the row and update new value set from different client in the meanwhile.
        Then, a search for equal items before timeReceived must be made.
        If no equal record exists, the an Insert is being generated and all devices must be notified.
        If there is a record, the md5 hashes must be compared (md5 made on data only)
        In case hashes are different, Update notification must be sent to all devices.
        If hashes are equal, old record is discarded leaving as current the new received record.
        EVERY DISCARD ACTION IS A SOFT-DELETE WITH FIELD isDeleted.
